    <ul>
        <li
            ><b>July 18, 1862, Holly Springs, MI</b>-
        Ida Bell Wells-Barnett (Ida B. Wells) was born
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1884, Memphis, TN</b>-
        Wells had begun teaching in black public schools.  
        Her career in education was interrupted by an incident on a train, 
        where the conductor told her to give up her seat for a white woman.  
        When Wells refused and the conductor tried to force her off, 
        Wells (quite literally) fought back and sued the train company.  
        She won, but months later, the ruling was thrown out
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1889</b>-
        Wells became involved in the field of journalism,
        working for the <i>Evening Star</i>, the <i>Living Word</i>,
        and became editor and co-owner of the <i>Free Speech and Headlight</i>
        (later shortened to <i>Free Speech</i> or <i>Memphis Free Speech</i>
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>May 9, 1982</b>-
        While lynching was an ever-present evil in Wells' time, 
        the lynching of three of her friends sparked her 
        motivation to see the practice abolished
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>May 23, 1892</b>-
        While Wells was away in Philadelphia, 
        intruders destroyed the <i>Free Speech</i> presses and offices.  
        Wells was determined to return to Memphis, 
        but stayed away when she received word of a group of black men 
        waiting to protect her should she return
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1892</b>-
        Wells began writing many works that exposed the true causes and horrors
        behind lynching, including <i>A Red Record: Tabulated Statistics and
        Alleged Causes of Lynching in the United States</i> (1895) and her most 
        notable work, <i>Southen Horrors: Lynch Laws in All Its Phases</i> (1892)
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>April-May 1893</b>- 
        Wells began lecturing in England, Scotland, and Wales,
        exposing the horrors of lynching of blacks to a wider audience
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1893, Chicago, IL</b>-
        Wells moved to Chicago and began working for the city's first black-American 
        newspaper, the <i>Chicago Conservative</i>
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>February 1894</b>- 
        Wells returned to England.  
        Her speeches inspired sympathizers overseas to 
        investigate and publicize lynching in America
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>June 1895</b>- 
        Wells married Ferdinand Lee Barnett, 
        a black lawyer and editor who had founded the <i>Chicago Conservative</i> 
        and supported his wife's endeavors.  Although they had four children, 
        this did not slow Wells-Barnett's fight for justice.  
        She brought her children on tours with her, 
        declaring herself the only woman in American history to make political speeches
        with a nursing baby
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1909</b>- 
        Wells was one of two women to sign “The Call”, a conference based on the discussion of 
        political and civil equality for blacks.
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>May 31, 1909</b>-
        "The Call" conference led to the formation of the 
        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), 
        officially formed in 1910.  Despite being a founder, 
        Wells was initially left out due to the NAACP wanting to distance themselves 
        from her forceful reporting and brutal honesty
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1913</b>-
        Wells founded the Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago, 
        the first suffrage organization for black women
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>July 7, 1919</b>-
        Following a 1917 race riot in East Saint Louis, Wells wrote a letter
        to the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, warning Chicago of the same outcome if 
        it does not "set the wheels of justice in motion".  The city took no action,
        and later endured one of the country's bloodiest race riots
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>1930</b>
        Wells ran as an independent candidate for state senator, but was unsuccessful
    </li>
        <li>
            <b>March 25, 1931, Chicago, IL</b>- 
        Ida B. Wells-Barnett passed away at age 68, before she was able to complete
        the final chapter of her autobiography
    </li>
        <p id="but"><b>But...</b></p>    
        <li>
            <b>1970</b>-
